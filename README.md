# Weather-Dashboard

Using moment.JS, AJAX and bootstrap, I created a weather app that uses OpenWeather API to allow users to search via City names and bring back the current temperature along with other values and also a five day forecast. The elements are created dynamically using JQuery, search results are stored and loaded when the search button is clicked. Event listeners have been added for search and buttons. 

GitHub deployed app:
